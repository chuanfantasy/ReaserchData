Title:          Review of the Digital Twin Technology Applications for Electrical Equipment Lifecycle Management
Subject:        Digital twin is one of the emerging technologies for the digital transformation of the power industry. Many existing studies claim that the widespread application of digital twins will shift the industry to a principally new level of development. This article provides an extensive overview of the industrial application experience of digital twin technologies for solving the problems of modern power systems with a particular focus on the task of high-voltage power equipment lifecycle management. The latter task contours one of the most promising areas for the application of the digital twins in the power industry since it requires deep analysis of the technological processes dynamics and the development of physical, mathematical and computer models that cover all the potential benefits of the digital twin technology. At the moment, there is a lack of reliable data on the problems of assessing and predicting the technical state of high-voltage power equipment. The use of digital twin technology in modern power systems will allow for aggregating data from a variety of real objects and will allow the automatization of collecting and processing of big data by implementing artificial intelligence methods, which will ultimately make it possible to manage the life cycle of the power equipment. The article puts to scrutiny the industrial experience of digital twins creation, considering the technical solutions suggested by the largest manufacturers of electrical equipment. A classification of digital twins, examples and main features of their application in the power industry, including the problem of managing the life cycle of high-voltage electrical equipment, are considered and discussed.
