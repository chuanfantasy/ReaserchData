3.1 Relational Attribute Label

The speciﬁc algorithm implementation process is as follows:

Firstly, we divide the access control of nodes according to the similarity of labels, and then adjust the access control adaptively by using game theory according to social attributes. Based on the model. The tag similarity algorithm gives the preliminary division basis of access control.

Input: Adjacency Matrix of Undirected Unweighted Graph Adjacentmatrix, node number VerticeNum.
Output: Classiﬁed array for storing node labels Community.

Deﬁnition 1. User tags are extracted from SloT’s social attribute resources, the user tag behavior is represented by a set of triples, where the Ra-data record (v, c, l) indicates that the user (node) v labels the category c with the content l.

Step 1: Save all neighbors of the i node into the neighbor array.
Step 2: When the classiﬁcation criteria are not met or the iteration threshold is not exceeded, the number of tags in the neighborhood of the node is counted.

v is the node Id, which is the account identiﬁer of the Step 3: If there is only one tag with the most number,

The number of labels m < k < n, m and n are both single values. If the value of k is too large, the interest labels of the account nodes may be too broad to be correctly classiﬁed into valid permission levels. If the value of k is too small, the fewer the labels, the larger the similarity value is or even close to 1. And we have to further deﬁne the weights for the k labels of node v.

So a total of sa == 2n kinds of collection behaviors. We stipulate that visitors must initiate SloT behavior to trigger the game, that is, the visitor initiates 2n − 1 sets containing SloT behaviors. The interviewee has corresponding sb = 2n − 1 permission policy selection. The interviewee expenditure (and is also the income of the visitor). When the visitor adopts the 2n −1 level SloT behavior, the interviewee gives the permission 2n−1 level to perform repeated games.

From Table 2, we can see that our adaptive model initially authorizes visitors according to their interest tags, allowing them to read part of the interviewee’s resources. Through the study of literature [3, 7], we can know that the social behavior of online visitors meets a certain degree of Gauss distribution, so we analyze the online social behavior of some users of a domestic website, and randomly select some users and related data as the behavior basis of our method.

In game theory, there are only two players, the visitor and the interviewee, but each player has a variety of strategic options, so we can calculate the expected payment of each person’s mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in the face of complex situations, in order to adapt to the more dynamic and changeable SloT environment.
