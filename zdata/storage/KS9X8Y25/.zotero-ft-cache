抽象

Accidents that occur at NPPs must be correctly identified so quickly that mitigation actions can be taken in a timely manner. Depending on the type of transient, the operating parameters follow different patterns and it might be possible to identify the transient by monitoring these parameters. Due to the large number of parameters of an NPP , it is necessary to determine the parameters that play a vital role in transient identification. Data-driven methods have shown effective performance for NPP transient identification. To determine the most important input parameters for NPP transient identification, the present paper has utilized a hybrid feature selection method, in which feature subsets are created using several filter methods and then the best feature subset is determined by comparing the training results of a deep Long Short-Term Memory network. According to the results, the Neighbourhood Components Analysis method has selected the best subset of features.
Introduction

During the operation of a nuclear power plant (NPP), there are many sensors that monitor various parameters of the NPP. When the NPP goes from a normal state to an abnormal state, a transient occurs and according to the classification of the transient, the changes in the NPP parameters follow a unique pattern (Moshkbar-Bakhshayesh and Ghofrani, 2013). By monitoring the changes in the NPP parameters during its operation, the type of transients can be identified in the initial moments. By recognizing the type of transient, preventive measures can be taken to prevent the transient from becoming an accident or to mitigate its consequences.

Due to the changes in many parameters and short time for transient identification, methods based on operator detection and model-based methods have low efficiency. Nowadays many studies in this field are based on data-driven methods, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs). The deep learning approach, which is an advanced branch of machine learning, has shown good performance in dealing with problems involving a large amount of training data, a large number of input features, and long time series (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1996, LeCun et al., 2015). In recent years, deep learning methods have been used successfully in many applications (Schmidhuber, 2015).

To classify NPP transients using an ANN, a number of parameters are used as input. Proper selection of these input parameters will increase the accuracy, generalization, and speed of classification. Determining the number and type of attributes used in transient identification is done by feature selection techniques (Fausett, 1994). Various studies have been conducted on the application of feature selection techniques in NPPs. For example, Zio (2006) has used the genetic algorithm to choose the optimal vector of features for the diagnosis of the NPP transients by a fuzzy classifier (Zio et al., 2006). In another study zhou (2017) has proposed a method to use principal component analysis for selecting the relevant features which has led to significantly reduction in the computation time and keeping the precision of the identification (Zhou et al., 2017). Moshkabr-Bakhshayesh (2021) has compared the efficiency of different feature selection methods in estimating NPP parameters using supervised learning algorithms (Moshkbar-Bakhshayesh, 2021a, Moshkbar-Bakhshayesh, 2021b). There are also other studies, all of which show that feature selection methods will increase accuracy and reduce computational costs (Baraldi et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2017, Zio et al., 2005). However, in the mentioned studies, the conventional ANNs have been used for transient identification, which are not desirable for practical application due to faulty performance in the case of long-term input time series and various transient classes (Santos et al., 2019). Hence, a deep learning approach is proposed for NPP transient identification. Since the training process of deep networks is much more time-consuming than conventional networks (Livni et al., 2014), it is not feasible to use iterative feature selection methods. To address this issue, in the present study, a hybrid feature selection method including statistical and training-based approaches was used to determine the best features.

In the present study, after a description of feature selection approaches in Section 2, the proposed feature selection method is introduced in Section 3. Numerical results related to the implementation of the proposed feature selection method are given in Section 4. The conclusion is presented in Section 5.

Feature selection approaches

Feature selection can be defined as the process of reducing the number of input variables by identifying the relevant features and removing those irrelevant or redundant. The feature selection can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms, increase the learning speed, and simplify the model. Moreover, a smaller number of features lead to a reduction in instrumentation costs. Regarding the relationship between the selection algorithm and the learning algorithm, feature selection
Proposed feature selection method

Considering the limitations of the various feature selection approaches mentioned in Section 2, the proposed method for determining the best features used in identifying NPP transients is a hybrid method as shown in Fig. 4. As discussed in Section 1, the deep learning method is chosen for NPP transient identification. Unlike conventional neural networks, which are often composed of simple interconnected units, deep neural networks, as will be described in Section 3.2., have much more trainable
Training data set

The data set used to apply the feature selection methods and train the neural network for transient identification, has been generated by a compact full-scope simulator of a VVER-1000 nuclear power plant. The data set consists of 227 different scenarios that are classified into 7 groups based on the initiating events. The transients include anticipated operational occurrences (AOO), design basis accidents (DBA), and normal operation (NO) conditions. The use of data related to the normal
Conclusion

In the present study, a hybrid feature selection method was used to determine the most important parameters of an NPP for transient identification. In this method, several feature subsets are generated by calculating the score of each feature using several filters. The feature subsets are applied for training a deep LSTM network to determine a feature subset that leads to the best performance of the network in transient identification among the generated subsets.

The training data have been
