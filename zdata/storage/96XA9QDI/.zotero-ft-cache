And it drives the operation of the virtual model through historical data and real-time collected data. Finally, it achieves the real mapping of the whole life cycle of the spacecraft in the virtual scene so as to realize the simulation prediction in the virtual environment.
In this paper, the digital twin system is used to simulate and reconstruct Brazilian jujitsu, which has multiple training advantages. As shown in Figure 1, the data twin reconﬁgurable system framework has a four-tier architecture, including the physical layer, model layer, service layer, and data layer.
3.2. Human Joint Twinning Algorithm. In order to meet the requirements of system ﬂexibility, scalability, and telepresence [9], this paper uses Unity3D to design the virtual space part of the digital twin system. Unity3D is one of the most popular commercial game engines at present. It is famous for its realistic environment, good scalability, cross platform, and active software ecology. Its internal script is written in c# language [10]. +is paper takes Brazilian jujitsu trainers as the research object and irb14000 dual arm cooperative robot as the simulation. +e schematic diagram of the degree of freedom of the trainer’s joint is shown in Figure 2.
+e joint angle corresponding to Figure 2 is shown in Table 1, and the motion range of each joint is shown in Table 2.

According to the above formula and following the
principles of scaling, rotation, and translation, the transformation matrix MCW from OCXCYCZC to OWXWYWZW can be obtained, and the transformation matrix MCW is shown in the formula:

MCW � MT · MRY · MRX · MRZ · MS.

(12)

When the operator operates on the screen, use the hand
controller to control the displacement of the robot joint end. Assuming that the displacement of the joint end OCXCYCZC in is pC and the displacement in OWXWYWZW is pW, pW can be obtained from the formula:

pW � MCW · pC.

(13)

In this paper, the movement of the joint end is based on
OVXVYVZV, so it is necessary to use OVXVYVZV to describe the displacement of the joint end under OWXWYWZW. Assuming that the displacement of the joint end in
OVXVYVZV is pV, pV can be obtained from the formula:

pV � MWV · pW.

(14)

Among them, MWV is the conversion matrix from OWXWYWZW to OVXVYVZV. Since the camera coordinate system and robot coordinate system are essentially local coordinate systems, MWV is the inverse matrix of MCW. As mentioned earlier, the diﬀerence between the real robot coordinate system and the coordinate system in Unity3D is that the real robot coordinate system is the right-hand coordinate system. +erefore, it is necessary to convert the displacement in the left-hand coordinate system to the right-hand coordinate system. For the displacement in the virtual robot coordinate system, assuming that the joint end displacement in the real robot is expressed as pr, then pr is obtained from the formula:

+e topology of WSNs is very dynamic [23]. However, there are also great diﬀerences between WSNs and traditional wireless ad hoc networks, which are mainly reﬂected in the following aspects: (1) limited node resources. Sensor nodes are generally powered by batteries. Due to the miniaturization of sensor nodes, the capacity of batteries is limited. In many sensor applications, nodes are deployed in areas with a poor environment, so it becomes very diﬃcult or almost impossible to replace batteries manually. +erefore, the energy of nodes is very valuable because of their limitations. Because of the limited energy, how to improve the energy eﬃciency of nodes has become one of the important indicators of WSNs key technology design. In addition, due to the use of an embedded microprocessor, the processor capacity and memory size are limited, resulting in

In the ﬁeld of public security, the WSNs system should minimize the false positive rate and false negative rate. In the ﬁeld of target tracking, WSNs system pays more attention to the real-time monitoring of emergencies. In the ﬁeld of health monitoring, more attention is paid to energy saving and protecting the privacy of monitored objects [24, 25]. It is precise because the characteristics of the WSNs are diﬀerent from other wireless networks, which makes the design of some key technologies of WSNs face many challenges. +e most important challenge is how to improve the energy eﬃciency of nodes when designing network protocols and data management algorithms [26, 27].

training platform is a complex training management and control platform composed of multiple systems. In order to

facilitate real-time data acquisition, physical information

fusion, data storage and transmission, visual monitoring, and online simulation of digital twin training, the platform is divided into 3 subsystems: OPCUA server, Demo3D visual simulation software, and general management system. In addition, as the basis for realizing digital twinning, the platform also needs to be extensible and extensible. By providing a data interface to cooperate with other appli-
D cation service systems, it can realize the functions of digital
twinning, such as deduction, simulation, decision-making, and so on. +e design idea of the digital twin training platform is shown in Figure 6.
E (1) Opcua server, the OPCUAserver of digital twin training, is the data transmission link between various systems. It is necessary to use the information modeling ability of OPCUAto realize physical information fusion and construct the T OPCUA transmission service. OPCUA server is directly deployed in physical training, and its function is mainly divided into two parts. First, through the direct access or protocol conversion of C manufacturing IOT equipment, it can realize the collection and data integration of full cycle, full element, and multidimensional data. It has the function of direct control over the production factors on the training site. +e second is to import the OPCUA information model, bind the A manufacturing IOT equipment to collect data, and complete the instantiation of the information model and the construction of address space so as to realize physical information fusion and information R interaction and sharing with the other two subsystems based on the information model.

Because the Demo3D software has the function of web page publishing, it can achieve a seamless connection with the overall management system through the URL link of the web page. So the whole digital twin training platform can be regarded as a system of B/S architecture.

+e Demo3D software is used to construct the virtual training scene of the digital twin training platform. By utilizing the functions and advantages of Demo3D software in modeling and simulation, this paper integrates Demo3D software into the digital twin training platform to realize two functions of visual monitoring and training model management. Visual monitoring is to display all production activities on the training site in the form of three-dimensional visualization through the collected real-time data. At the same time, it pushes some production status information in real-time to realize the eﬀect of virtual real mapping. Training model management is the process of constructing, conﬁguring, and storing the virtual models corresponding to all production factors in virtual training. It plays the role of a physical object database in a digital twin training platform.

In order to meet the operational needs of training managers and maintain the convenience of platform de-
C velopment and deployment, this paper selects B/S archi-
tecture to develop this platform. For the OPCUA server, because it needs to connect with many hardware devices, and many devices do not directly support the OPCUA protocol, this paper needs to be written in a uniﬁed language
A to maintain a close relationship between the two. In addi-
tion, although OPCUA service software such as kepserver has appeared, due to the need to realize the physical information fusion process, the open source library of OPCUA must be used for server development. Table 3 lists the

It needs to import the three into Demo3D software, package them uniformly, and build a virtual model library. (1) +e geometric model Demo3D software does not support direct modeling. It needs to use SolidWorks, ProE, and other three-dimensional modeling software to make real modeling of various production elements and training structures in training and save them into Demo3D software in the middle format. (2) +e physical model is based on the geometric model of the imported production factors. By deﬁning the function of the model attribute of the Demo3D software, the basic attributes of each production factor model and the dynamic variables of the control model change and mobile are deﬁned. It realizes the physical model construction corresponding to the geometric model. (3) +e logic model is based on the script writing function of Demo3D software, which uses the JScript language to write the logic script of the model. It realizes the connection with physical training and application services through OPCUAand database, realizes the evolution and simulation function of the logical model, and constructs the virtual model library.
4.3. System. For the digital twin environment, the real-time performance of data transmission and interaction is an important index to measure the performance of data interaction. +ere are still disputes about the maximum data transmission time delay acceptable for digital twin training. It is generally believed that the time delay from data collection to transmission to the data application module should be less than 20m [26, 28]. In order to verify the eﬀectiveness of the information modeling method in this paper, it needs to model the information for the speciﬁc data acquisition node of physical training and build the corresponding OPCUA server and client. Because the data interaction between the OPCUA server and client has two transmission mechanisms: direct transmission and subscription, this paper uses diﬀerent ways

5. Conclusion
+e cultural value of Brazilian jujitsu is reﬂected in three aspects. (1) +e “melting pot” culture is embodied in Brazilian jujitsu. Brazilian jujitsu does not stick to one style and is good at learning from other technologies. While integrating the ﬁghting technology of various countries, it also adds the cultural connotation of various countries to its own jujitsu system. It is not only a sport but also a representative of cultural integration. (2) +e etiquette culture of Brazilian jujitsu. Although Brazilian jujitsu has not developed for a long time, it has always inherited the rigorous etiquette culture of Japanese traditional judo. It is very similar to Japanese judo in many places. (3) Brazilian jujitsu highlights the ﬁghting culture. +rough the confrontation of Brazilian jujitsu, people feel the Brazilian people’s love for ﬁghting. In this paper, the training system is studied, and the experimental results are also satisfactory. However, the article also has deﬁciencies. For example, in luansheng system, this paper selects too few joint points for human body simulation and can not simulate speciﬁc details. +erefore, in future research, it will also focus on more detailed twin simulations.
